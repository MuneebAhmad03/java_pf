This repository focuses on building a strong understanding of fundamental Java programming concepts, initially covering core syntax, data types, operators, and control flow statements. It provides clear examples and practical code snippets to help learners grasp these essential building blocks of Java. While the current scope centers on these foundational elements, this repository aims to lay a solid groundwork for future exploration of more advanced topics. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts are not included in the current content, allowing for a focused introduction to the basic mechanics of the Java language. Stay tuned for potential expansions in the future!
